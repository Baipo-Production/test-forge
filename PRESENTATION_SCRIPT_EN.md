# 🎤 TestForge Presentation Script (English Version)

## 🎯 Opening (30 seconds)

**"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone!**

Today I'm excited to present **TestForge** — an automated test case generation and execution platform that transforms Excel files into comprehensive Robot Framework test suites with real-time monitoring.

Let me walk you through the problem we're solving, our solution, and a live demo."

---

## 📊 Problem Statement (1 minute)

**"First, let's talk about the challenges QA teams face:**

1. **Time-consuming** — Creating test cases for all parameter combinations can take days or weeks
2. **Error-prone** — Manual data entry leads to inconsistencies and missed edge cases
3. **Hard to maintain** — A single API change requires updating hundreds of test files
4. **No visibility** — Teams can't see test progress in real-time

**For example:** An API with just 4 parameters, each having 5 possible values, creates **625 combinations**. Writing these manually is impractical.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview (1 minute)

**"TestForge solves this with a 4-step automated workflow:**

1. **Generate** — Upload a CSV/Excel with parameter values → Get all combinations
2. **Compile** — Fill in expected results → Compile to Robot Framework test files
3. **Execute** — Run tests with real-time SSE streaming
4. **Report** — Download comprehensive HTML/XML reports

**Key Benefits:**
- ⚡ **90% time reduction** in test case creation
- 🎯 **100% coverage** of parameter combinations
- 📊 **Real-time visibility** via Server-Sent Events
- 🔄 **CI/CD ready** with GitHub Actions integration

## 🏗️ Architecture (1 minute)

**"Let me show you the technical architecture:**

```
Client uploads CSV → FastAPI Backend → Combination Service
                                     ↓
                    Excel with combinations (2 sheets: data + notes)
                                     ↓
Client fills expectations → Compile Service → Robot Framework .robot files
                                     ↓
                          Run Service (async) → SSE real-time streaming
                                     ↓
                    Reports (HTML/XML) → Download as ZIP
```

**Tech Stack:**
- **Backend:** FastAPI (async Python framework)
- **Test Framework:** Robot Framework with RequestsLibrary
- **Streaming:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates
- **Storage:** File-based workspace with organized directories
- **Deployment:** Docker + docker-compose for containerization

## 🎬 Live Demo (3-4 minutes)

### **Step 1: Generate Combinations**

**"Let me show you a real example. I have a CSV file with:**
- Gender: Male, Female
- Age: 18-30, 31-50
- Nationality: Australia, Canada
- Religion: Buddhist, Christian

**Watch what happens when I upload this..."**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/combination-test-case \
  -F "file=@input.csv" \
  -o combination_testcases.xlsx
```

**"The system generates an Excel file with 16 combinations (2×2×2×2) across two sheets:**
1. **Combination sheet** — All parameter combinations
2. **Note sheet** — Instructions for filling expected results

---

### **Step 2: Compile to Robot Framework**

**"After filling in expected status codes and response bodies, I upload the completed Excel..."**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/compile-test-case \
  -F "testName=demo-api" \
  -F "file=@combination_filled.xlsx"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "compiled",
  "testName": "demo-api",
  "cases": 96,
  "run_url": "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/run-test-case/demo-api/stream"
}
```

**"96 Robot Framework test files are now generated in `workspace/demo-api/generated/`"**

---

### **Step 3: Execute with Real-Time Streaming**

**"Now let's run the tests and watch the progress in real-time via SSE..."**

**Open browser to:** `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/run-test-case/demo-api/stream`

**SSE Events you'll see:**
```
event: connect
data: {"status":"connected","message":"Test execution started"}

event: process
data: {"case":"TC_001","status":"running","message":"Running TC_001"}

event: pass
data: {"case":"TC_001","status":"pass","message":"Test pass"}

event: fail
data: {"case":"TC_042","status":"fail","message":"Expected 200, got 400"}

event: done
data: {"status":"completed","summary":{"total":96,"passed":90,"failed":6,"skipped":0},"download_url":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/download/demo-api/2025-10-30_14-30-15"}
```

---

### **Step 4: Download Reports**

**"Finally, we can download the complete test report..."**

```bash
curl -o report.zip \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/download/demo-api/2025-10-30_14-30-15
```

**"The ZIP contains:**
- `log.html` — Detailed execution logs
- `report.html` — Summary dashboard
- `output.xml` — Machine-readable results for CI/CD

## 💬 Q&A Preparation

### **Common Questions:**

**Q: How does this compare to Postman collections?**  
A: TestForge focuses on *combinatorial testing* with automated generation. Postman requires manual creation of each request. We also provide real-time SSE streaming and Robot Framework's powerful assertion library.

**Q: What about API authentication?**  
A: You can add `[Request][Header]Authorization` in your Excel. The system supports any header-based auth (Bearer tokens, API keys, etc.).

**Q: Can it handle nested JSON?**  
A: Yes! Use dot notation: `[Request][Body]user.profile.name` or array indexing: `[Request][Body]children[0].name`

**Q: Performance with large test suites?**  
A: We've tested with 10,000+ combinations. The bottleneck is usually the target API, not TestForge. We support parallel execution via Robot Framework's `--processes` flag.

**Q: How do I validate complex response structures?**  
A: Use assertion operators: `[Response][Body]age:gt[Type:int]` validates age > expected value. We support 15+ operators including regex and type validation.

**"To summarize:**

TestForge transforms the tedious process of combinatorial API testing into an automated, scalable solution. With just 4 steps — Generate, Compile, Execute, Report — teams can achieve comprehensive test coverage in minutes, not days.

**Thank you! I'm happy to answer any questions."**
